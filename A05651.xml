            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And if a man purchaſe landes in fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and dye without

how farre ſoeuer that he be from hym of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may inherite and haue the

hath a brother, which is vncle vnto the ſonne, and the ſon purchaſeth
lande in fee ſimple and dyeth without iſſue liuyng the father, the vncle
ſhall haue the lande, as<pb facs="tcp:29073:4"/>heire vnto the ſonne, &amp; not the

               <p>And in ſuch caſe where the ſon purchaſeth land in fee
ſimple, &amp; dieth without iſſue, they of his bloud on the fathers
ſide ſhal inheryte as heyre vnto hym, before any of the bloud of the
mothers ſide. But if he haue none heyre on the fathers ſyde, than ſhall
the land diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto his heire on the mothers ſide. And thys is the
oppinion of al the Iuſtices. M. 12. E. 4. fol. 14. But there it was holden if
any lande diſcend vnto a man by the fathers ſyde which dyeth without

that is to ſay the next of bloud of the father of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fathers ſyde.
And for defaut of ſuch an heyre thei that be of the fathers bloud of the
parte of the mothers, of the father (that is to ſaye) the grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmother ought
to inherite. And if ther be no ſuch heire on the fathers ſyde, than the
lorde ſhall haue the land by eſchete. And ſo it is if a man take a wyfe

more worthy of bloud.</p>
               <p>¶And it is to bee vnderſtande that no man ſhal haue
lande in fee ſimple by diſcent as heyre vnto any manne, but that he be hys
heire of the hole bloud. For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue iſſue 2. ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, by. 2.
ventres &amp; the elder purchaſeth<pb facs="tcp:29073:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>land in fee ſimple and
dyeth without iſſue, the yonger brother ſhal not haue the land but the
vncle of the elder brother or ſome other hys nigh coſyn ſhal haue it, for
that, that the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is but of the halfe bloude to the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. And if
a man haue a ſon and a daughter by one ventre, and a ſon by a nother
ventre, and the ſonne by the firſt ventre purchaſeth lande in fee
ſimple and dyeth without iſſue, the liſter ſhall haue the lande by
diſcente as heyre vnto her brother and not the younger brother, for that that
the ſiſter is of the whole bloude to her elder brother.</p>
               <p>And alſo where a man is ſeaſed of land in fee ſimple,
and he hath iſſue a ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by one ventre and a ſon by a
nother ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and dyeth, and the elder ſon entreth and dyeth without
iſſue, the daughter ſhall haue the lande and not the yonger ſon, and
yet is the yonger ſon heyre vnto his father and not-his brother. But if the
elder ſon enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lande after the death of his father, but dyeth
before enter made by hym, then the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger brother may enter and haue the lande
as heire vnto his father. But where the elder ſon in the caſe aforeſayde
entreth after the death of his father and therof hath poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than
the ſiſter ſhal haue the lande. Quia poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio fratris de feodo
ſimplici facit ſororem eſſe heredem. For the poſſeſſion of the
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fee ſimple maketh the ſiſter to be heir.</p>
               <p>But if there bee two brethren by dyuers<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29073:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>ventres, and the elder is ſeaſed in fee ſimple and dyeth without
iſſue and his vncle entreth as heire vnto hym, which alſo dyeth without
iſſue, than the yonger brother maye haue the lande as heyre vnto his vncle,
becauſe he is of the whole bloude to hym though he be but of half bloude vnto
his elder brother.</p>
               <p>And it is to vnderſtande that this worde inheritaunce, is not
onely vnderſtand where a man hath landes or tenementes by diſcent of
heritage. But alſo euery fee ſimple or fee tayls that a man hath by his
purchaſe, may be ſayde inheritaunce, for that, that his heyres may inherite
hym. For in a writ of right that a man bryngeth of land, that was of his own
purchaſe, the writ ſhal ſaye: Quam clamat eſſe ius &amp; here ditatem
ſuam. That is to ſaye, which he claymeth to be his ryght and his
in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heritaunce. And ſo it ſhal be ſayde in diuers other writes which a man
or a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of theyr owne purchaſe, as it appereth by the
regiſter.</p>
               <p>And of ſuche thynges as a man may haue a manuell occupacion,
poſſeſſion, or reſcent as of landes, tenementes, rentes, and ſuch
other, a man ſhall ſay in his pledyng and in way of barre, that one ſuch
was ſeaſed in his demeſn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as of fee. But of ſuche thynges that lye not
in manuell occupacion. &amp;c. as of auowſon of a churche, and ſuch maner
thing, there he ſhall ſaye that he was ſeaſed as of fee. and not in his
demeſne as of fee. And in latin it is in<pb facs="tcp:29073:6"/>the ſame caſe ſayd.

               <p>TEnaunt in fee tayle is by force of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of

ſtatute tenaunt in the taile is ſayde in two maners, that is to ſay,
tenant in taile generall, &amp; tenant en tayle ſpeciall.</p>
               <p>Tenaunt in tayle generall, is wher landes or tenementes be geuen

inherite the tenementes by force of the ſayde gyft, becauſe that euery
ſuch iſſue is of his body engendred.</p>
               <p>In the ſame maner is where landes and tenementes be geuen to a
woman and to the heires co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of her body how be it that ſhe haue many
houſbandes, yet the iſſue that ſhe may haue by eche huſbande may
inheryte as iſſue in the tayle by force of ſuche gyftes. And therfore
ſuch gyftes been called general tayle.</p>
               <p>Tenant in tayle ſpeciall, is where landed and tenementes he
geuen vnto a man and his wife and the heires of theyr two bodyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. In
ſuch caſe none may inherit by force of ſuch gift, but thoſe that be
engendred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them two and it is called eſpecial tail for that if the
wyfe dye, &amp; he taketh another wyfe and hath iſſue the iſſue of the
ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wife ſhal neuer inherite by force of ſuch gyft. Nor alſo the
iſſue of the ſeconde houſbande yf the fyrſt huſband dye.</p>
               <p>In the ſame maner it is where landes and tenementes bee geuen
by a man vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with a wyfe, which is the daughter or coſyn to the
geuer in franke mariage. which gift hath inheritance by theſe wordes franke
mariage vnto it annexed, howbeit that they be not expreſſy ſayde or

them two engendred, &amp; thys is ſayde eſpecial tayle for that the
iſſue of the ſeconde wife may not inherite.</p>
               <p>And note wel that this worde tallyare is to ſay to ſet vnto
ſome certaintie or els limit vnto ſome certain inheritance. And for that,
that it is limit &amp; ſet in certain, what iſſue ſhal inherite by
force of ſuch giftes, and how long that the inheritance ſhal indure:
Therfore it is called in latin feodum talliatum .i. heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas in quadam
certitudine limitata. For if te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in general taile die without iſſue the
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or his heires ſhall inherite as in theyr reuercion. In the ſame
wyſe is of the tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the tayle ſpecial. &amp;c. For in euery gyfte of
the tayle without more ſaying, the reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of fee ſimple is in the
donour.</p>
               <p>And the donees and theyr heyres ſhall do to the donour and to
hys heyres, ſuche ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the donour dothe vnto his lorde next aboue.
Excepte the donees in franke Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, whiche ſhall holde quietely from
euerye maner ſeruice (but if it be for fealtie) vntyll the fourth degree bee
paſſe. And after that the fourth degree is paſt, the iſſue in the
fifth degree and ſo foorth the other iſſues after hym, ſhall holde of
the donour &amp; of his heires, as they holde ouer as is aforeſayde.</p>
               <p>And the degrees in franke mariage ſhalbe accompted in ſuch
maner, that is to ſay, from the donour to the donees in franke mariage the
fyrſt degre, for that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wife that is one<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29073:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>of
the donees ought to bee daughter ſyſter or other coſyn to the donour. And
from the donees vnto theyr iſſue ſhalbe accompted the ſeconde degree.
And from theyr iſſue vnto theyr iſſue, the thyrde degree and ſo
forth. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the cauſe is, for that after euery ſuch gyft, the
iſſues that come of the donour, and the iſſues that come of the donees
after the fourth degree paſte, of bothe parties in ſuche forme to bee
accompted, may betwixt them by the law of holy churche intermarye. And that the
donee in franke mariage ſhall be the fyrſt degree of the fowre degrees a
man may ſe in a plee vpon a write of ryght of warde. Anno 31. E. 3. wher the

               <p>Alſo there bee diuers other eſtates in the tayle, howbeit
that they be not ſpecifyed by expreſſe woordes in the ſayde eſtatute,

heyre male ſhall inherite, and the iſſue fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſhall neuer inherite,
yet in theſe other tayles aforeſayd it is otherwyſe. In theſame maner
it is yf landes be geuen to a man and<pb facs="tcp:29073:8"/>to heires females of his body

               <p>Alſo yf landes be geuen to a man and hys heyres that he

dowers, that is to ſay, dower called dowement in the church doore and dower
called dowment by the fathers aſſent. Dowement at the churche dore is,
where a man of ful age is ſeaſed in fee ſimple whiche ſhall be wedded
vnto a wyfe, when he cometh vnto the churche doore, and there after affyaunce,
and trueth plight made beetwene them, endoweth hys wyfe of his whole lande, or
of the halfe or leſſe parcell, &amp; there openly declare the quantitie and
the cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne of hys lande that ſhe ſhall haue for her dower. In thys
caſe the wyfe after the death of her houſbande ſhall entre into the
ſaid qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of lande, of which her houſband endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her without the
aſſignement of any manne. Downement by the fathers aſſent, is where the
father is ſeaſed of tenementes in fee, and hys ſonne and heyre apparente
when he is wedded, indoweth hys wyfe at the churche doore of parcell of the
landes or tenementes of his fathers of thaſſent of hys father, and
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſygneth the quantitie of the parcelles. In this caſe after the death
of the ſonne, the wyfe ſhal enter in theſame parcell without the
aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any other. But it hath ben ſayd in this caſe that it
behoueth the wyfe to haue a dede of the father, prouyng his aſſent and
conſent of ſuche indowement. And if after the deaths of the houſbande
ſhe enter and agree to anye ſuche dower of the ſayde two dowers at the
churche doore, than ſhe is concluded to claime<pb facs="tcp:29073:11"/>any other Dower by
the common lawe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye landes or tenementes, whiche were of her ſayde
houſebande. But if ſhe will ſhe may refuſe ſuche Dower at the Churche
doore, &amp; than ſhe may be endowed after the courſe of the common lawe.
And note well that no wyfe ſhall bee endowed of the fathers aſſent in the
fourme aforefayde, ſaue where the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſonne and heyre apparaunte
to hys father.</p>
               <p>¶Inquere in theſe twoo caſes of Endowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the

paſſe not the age of .9. yeres, if ſhe ſhal haue ſuch Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or

               <p>¶And note well, that in all caſes where the certaynetie
appeareth what landes or tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes the wyfe ſhall haue for her Dower, the
wyfe maye enter after the deathe of her houſebande without aſſygnement of
anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But where the certayne appeareth not, as to be endowed of the
thyrde parte to haue in ſeuerall, or to bee endowed of the halfe after the
cuſtome to holde in ſeueraltie. In ſuche caſes it behoueth that her
Dower be vnto her aſſygned after the deathe of her houſebande, becauſe
it is not limitte beefore the aſſygnemente what parte of lande or
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementes ſhe ſhal haue for her Dower. But if there bee twoo ioyntenantes
of certayne landes in fee, and the one alyeneth that, that to hym pertayneth
and belongeth, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29073:11"/>in fee, which taketh a wyfe and

of the halfe that her huſbande purchaſed, to holde in common and occupye in
common as her part amounteth with the heyre of her houſeband, and with the
other ioyntenant whiche aliened not, for that in ſuch caſe her dower may be
aſſigned by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and boundes.</p>
               <p>¶And it is to vnderſtande, that the wyfe ſhall not be
endowed of landes or tenementes that her huſband ioyntly helde with another
at the tyme of his death. But where he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwiſe it is, as
in the caſe aforeſayde. And it is to wit that if the tenant in tayle endowe
his wife at the church dore as it is aforeſaid that ſhall ſerue for
little or naught to the wyfe for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> after the death of her huſband the
iſſue in the tayle may entre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wife, &amp;
ſo may he in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ther be none iſſue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tayle alyue.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if a manne ſeyſed in fee ſimple being within
age endowe his wife at the churche dore, and dyeth, and the wife entreth. In
this caſe the heyre of the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may put her out. But otherwiſe it is
as it ſemeth where the father is ſeyſed in fee, and the ſonne within
age endowe hys wyfe of his fathers aſſente, the father than being of full
age.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo there is another Dower whiche is called Dowement de
la pius beale. And that is as in ſuche caſe that a manne is ſeiſed
<pb facs="tcp:29073:12"/>of .xl. acres of lande, and he holdeth .xx. of the ſayd .xl.
acres of one man by knightes ſeruice, and the other .xx. acres of an other in

by the court that the wife endow her ſelf of the moſt fayre called plus
beale of the tenementes that ſhe hath as wardeyn in ſocage after the value
of the third parte that ſhe claymeth to haue of the tenementes in chi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ualrye
by her writ of Dower, and if the wife may not gainſay it, then the iudgement
ſhalbe made that the wardein in chiualrye ſhal hold the landes holden of
hym during the nonage of the chylde quyte from the woman &amp;c. And that the
woman may endowe her ſelfe of the moſt fayre part of the landes that ſhe

ſuche iudgement geuen, the wyfe may take her neyghboures, and in theyr

be eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay if that one haue fee ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in that one la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that
the other ſhal haue ſuch eſtate in the other la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and if the one hath fee
tayle in the one land, than the other ſhal haue likewiſe in the other la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the leſſee by force of the leaſe, hath right incontinent to haue the

leſſour ſhall haue agaynſt him a writte of waſte, and the writte
ſhall ſaye: Qui tenet ad terminum annorum. But he ſhall haue a ſpeciall

after the cuſtome of the maner, but the lorde wyll not breake the cuſtome
that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in ſuche caſes. But Brian chyef Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſayth,
that his oppinion alwayes hath been and alwayes ſhalbe, if ſuch a tenaunt
by cuſtome (paying his ſeruices) bee caſt out by the lorde he ſhall

op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinon of Danby chief Iuſtice. M. 7. E. 4. for he ſayth that the tenant
by the cuſtome is aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wel inherite to haue his lande after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
aſwell as he that hath franktenement by the comon lawe.</p>
               <p>TEnauntes by the yarde, be in ſuche nature as tenauntes by
copy of court rolle. But the cauſe for which they be called tenauntes by the
rodde or yarde, is for that whan they wyll ſurrender theyr tenementes into
the lordes hande to the vſe of another, they ſhall haue a little yarde or
rodde, by the cuſtome &amp; vſe of theyr handes which they ſhall delyuer
vnto the Stewarde or baylife, after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and vſe of the maner. And
he that ſhal haue the land ſhall take the ſame lande in the court, and
his takyng ſhalbe entred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rolle And the ſtewarde or the baylife
according to<pb facs="tcp:29073:19"/>to the cuſtome ſhall deliuer vnto hym that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the land the ſame yarde or another yarde in the name of ſeiſin. And for
this cauſe they be called tenauntes by the yarde. But they haue none other
euidence but copy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rolle.</p>
               <p>¶And alſo in diuers lordſhippes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there is
ſuch cuſtome, if ſuche a tenaunt that holdeth by the cuſtome wyll alyen
hys landes or tenementes, he may ſurrendre hys landes vnto the bailiffe or to
the reue, or to two ſad men of theſame Lordſhip, to the vſe of him that
ſhall haue the lande, to haue in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhall haue the land by copye of court rolle, ſhall haue theſame
lande after the entent of the ſurrendre. And ſo it is to wete that in
diuers lordſhippes and diuers maners ther be made diuers cuſtomes in ſuch
caſe, as to take tenauntes and as to plede and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching other thinges and
cuſtomes to be done and all that that is not againſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may wel be
admitted and alowed. And ſuch tenauntes that holde after the cuſtome of a
ſeignorye or after the cuſtome of a maner though thei haue eſtate of
inheritance after the cuſtome of the lordſhip or of the maner, yet
becauſe thei haue not any freholde by the courte of the common law, they be
called tenantes by baſe tenure.</p>
               <p>¶And diuers diuerſities ther be betwene a tenant at wil
which is in by the leſſee of his<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29073:19"/>leſſour by the
cours of the common law, and tenaunt after the cuſtome and maner in the forme
aforeſaide. For tenant at wyl after the cuſtom may haue eſtate of
inheritance as it is aforeſayde at the lordes wyl after the cuſtome &amp;
vſage of the maner. But if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des or tenementes which be not
within ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or lordſhip where ſuch cuſtome hath been vſed in
the forme aforeſayde, and wyl let ſuch landes or tenementes to another, to

theſe words to the heyres of the leſſe, be voide for this is the cauſe
if the leſſee dye, and his heire e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treth the leſſour ſhal haue a good

treſpas.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo tenaunt by the cuſtome in ſome places ought to

               <head>¶ Eſcuage.</head>
               <p>EScuage is called in latin Scutagium, that is to ſay ſeruice
of ſhielde. And ſuch a tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that holdeth his lande by eſcuage, holdeth
by knightes ſeruice. And alſo it is comenly ſayd that ſome hold by a fe
of knightes ſeruice and ſome by the halfe fee of knightes ſeruice.
&amp;c. And it is ſaid that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng maketh a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age rotal into
Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for to ſubdue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scots he that holdeth by a fee of knightes

arrayed for the war. And<pb facs="tcp:29073:22"/>lykewyſe he that holdeth his lande by

dayes. And he that holdeth hys la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the fourth part of a fe by knightes
ſeruice, hym behoueth to be with the kyng by x. dayes. And ſo after the
quantitie, he that hath more to do more and he that hath leſſe to do
leſſe. But it appeareth by the plees and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes made in a good plee
vpon a wryte of Detenue of an obligacion brought by one Harry Gray. Anno. 7. E.
3. That it nedeth not to hem that holdeth by eſcuage to go hymſelfe yf he
wyll fynde an able parſon for the warre couenably arrayed for the warre to go
wyth the kyng, and that ſemeth good reaſon. For it may be that he that
holdeth by ſuch ſeruice is ſycke in ſuche wyſe, that may not go nor
ryde.</p>
               <p>¶And alſo an Abbot or any other man of religion or a
woman ſole that holdeth by ſuch ſeruyce, ought not in ſuch caſe to go
in proper parſon. And ſyr william Herle that time chief Iuſtyce of the
common place ſayd in the ſayd plee that eſcuage ſhall not bee graunted
but where the kyng hymſelf goeth in proper par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And ſo it abode in
iudgement in the ſame plee yf theſe .xl. dayes ſhalbe accompted from the
day of the muſter of the kinges hoſt made by the commons and by the kynges
commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶And after ſuche voyage into Scotlande<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29073:22"/>it is commonly ſayde, that by the auctoritye of parliament the
eſcuage ſhall be ſet and put in certayne, that is for to ſaye a certayn
ſomme of money, howe much euery that holdeth by a whole fee of knyghtes
ſeruice which was not in his own proper parſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor none other with hym
with the kyng ſhall paye vnto the Lorde of whom he holdeth his lande by
eſcuage. As put caſe that it was ordeined by auctoritie of parliament that
euery that holdeth by a whole fee by knyght ſeruice which was not with the
kyng, ſhall pay to his lorde .xl. <abbr>s.</abbr> Than he that holdeth by the
halfe of a fee by knyghtes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſhall paye vnto his lorde but xx.
<abbr>s.</abbr> and ſo who more more, and who leſſe leſſe. And ſome
tenauntes hold that yf eſcuage renne by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of parliament to any
ſumme of money that they ſhall paye but the halfe of that ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me &amp;
ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me but the fourth part of that ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me. But becauſe the eſcuage that
they ſhall pay is not certayne for that it is at no certayn what the
parliament wil aſſeſe the eſcuage they holde by knyghtes ſeruice. But
otherwyſe it is of eſcuage certayne of which ſhalbe ſpoken of in the
tenure of ſocage.</p>
               <p>¶And yf a man ſpeake generally of eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it ſhall
be vnderſtande by the common ſpeache of eſcuage not certayne whiche is
knyghtes ſeruyce. And ſuche eſcuage draweth vnto hym homage, and homage
draweth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym fealtie, for fealtie is incident to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye maner of
ſeruyce, but to the tenure of<pb facs="tcp:29073:23"/>franke almoygne as it ſhalbe

geuen by the ſtatute of weſtmynſter the fyrſt. cap. 22. that by two
yere next folowyng the ſayde .xiii. yere, the Lorde maye tender a conuenyent
mariage without dyperagyng of ſuche an heyre female. And yf the lord do not
tender her ſuche mariage within the ſaid two yere, than ſhe at the ende
of the ſayd two yere may enter and put out the lorde. But yf ſuche an heyre
female be maryed within the age of xiiii. yere in the lyfe of the aunceſter,
and the aunceſter dye ſhe beyng within the age of xiiii. yere the lorde
ſhall haue but the warde of the lande tyll a ende of .xiiii. yere of age of

whiche is wedded within ſuche age to a woman may agree to the maryage or

               <p>¶And yf the wardeyne in chiualrye mary once his warde
within the age of .xiiii. yere, &amp; after the age of .xiiii. yere he
diſagreeth to the maryage. It is ſayde by ſome folke that the chylde is
not holden by the lawe to bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed another tyme by his wardeyne, for that
the wardeyne had once the mariage of hym, and therfore he was out of his ward

In the ſame maner it is yf the wardeyne marye hym and the wyfe dye, the

ſuche accoumpte made by hym, the heyre is of that withoute remedye, for that
no wrytte of accoumpte lyeth agaynſte the executoures, but onely for the

reliefe is due to the lord incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, of what age ſoeuer the heyre bee,
for that ſuch a lorde may not haue the warde of the bodye nor the lande of

reliefe after the termes &amp; dayes of payment of the rent, but he ought to
haue hys reliefe incontinence. And therefore he maye incontinent dyſtrayne
after the deathe of his tenaunte for the reliefe. In the ſame maner it is,
where a tenaunt holdeth of hys lord by fealte, and by a pounde of cummyn, or a

lorde ought to abyde to diſtrayne for hys reliefe tyll a certayne tyme. As if
the tenaunte holde of hys lorde by a roſe or by a buſhel of roſes to pay

whan the lord dyſtrayneth in the land holden of hym for his rent behind yf
the dyſtreſſe be reſerued fro hym or the lord come vpon the lande and
woulde dyſtrayne &amp; the tenaunt or another manne wyll not ſuffer hym.
&amp;c. Repleuyn is whan the lorde hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, and repleuyn is made of
the diſtres by wryt or by playnt. &amp;c. Encloſure is yf the landes and
tenementes bee ſo encloſed that the lorde may not come within the lande and

diſſeiſins made to the lorde is for this by ſuche thynges the lord is
diſturbed of the meane by which he ought to<pb facs="tcp:29073:51"/>haue come to his

rent charge as it is aforeſayde of rent ſecke &amp; two cauſes be of
diſſeyſin of rent ſecke that is to ſay encloſure and denyer and yet
it ſemeth that ther is another cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin of al the thre

manaſeth hym in ſuche forme that he dare not come to the land for to

this is a diſſeiſyn for this that the lord is diſturbed of the mean

and manaſſing he that hath re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t charge or rent ſeck is forſtalled or

prooued by a ple of an Aſſyſe in the<pb facs="tcp:29073:92"/>booke of aſſyſe.
Anno. xxxviii. E. iii. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of which enſueth in thys fourme.</p>
               <p>¶In the countie of Dorſet before theſame Iuſtices it
was founden by verdit of Aſſyſe, that the pleyntif which had ryght by
dyſcent of heritage to haue the tenementes putte in playnt at the tyme of the
death of hys aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre which was dwelling in the town where the tenementes
wer, and by woord claymeth the tenementes among hys neyghbours, but for doubt
of death he durſt not approche vnto the tenementes, but bryngeth
aſſyſe, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the matter founde, it was awarded that he ſhould
recouer.</p>
               <p>¶The thyrd thyng is to vnderſtande within what tyme the
clayme that is ſayd continual clayme ſhal ſerue, and helpe hym that
maketh the clayme and hys heyre. And as to this it is to wete that he that hath
tytle to enter wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will make hys clayme, and if he dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche vnto the
land. Than it behoueth hym to goe vnto the land, or to parcel of it, &amp; make
hys clayme. And yf he dare not approche vnto the land for dreade of beatyng,
mayming, or death, than it behoueth hym to goe. and to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proche as nigh as he
dare toward the land or parcel therof, and make his claime And if his
aduerſary that occupyeth the land, dye ſeyſed in fee or in fee tayle
within a yere and a daye after ſuch clayme made, by whiche the tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
diſcend vnto his ſonne as heyre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, yet may he that made the clayme
enter<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29073:92"/>vpon the poſſeſſion of the heyres. But in thys
caſe after the yere &amp; the day that ſuch clayme was made if none other
claym be made, if the father then dye ſeiſed, the morowe after the yere and
the day, or at another day after. &amp;c. than may not he that made the clayme
enter. And therfore if he that made the clayme will be ſure alway that hys
entre ſhall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye by ſuche diſcent, it behoueth hym that
within the yere and the day after the firſt clayme, to make another clayme in
the fourme aforeſayd. And within the yere and the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond
claym to make the thyrd claym in theſame maner, and within the yere &amp; the
day after the thyrd clayme, to make another clayme and ſo forth, that is to
ſay, to make an other clayme within euery yere and day next after euerye
clayme made, duryng the lyfe of hys aduerſary, and than at what tyme that hys
aduerſary dye, his entre ſhal not be taken away by no ſuch diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And
ſuch claym made in ſuch maner is moſt commonly taken, and called
continual clayme of him that made the clayme. But yet in caſe aforeſayd
where his aduerſary dyeth within the yere and the daye next after the fyrſt
clayme, thys is in the law a continual clayme, in ſo much that his
aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dyed within the yere and the daye after theſame clayme for it is
no nede for him that made the clayme to make anye other clayme, but at that
tyme that he within theſame yere and the day &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29073:93"/>¶Alſo if his aduerſary be diſſeiſed
within the yere &amp; a day after the claym, and the diſſeiſour dyeth
therof ſeiſed within the yere &amp; the day &amp;c. Thys dying ſeiſed
ſhall not hurt him that made the claym, but that he may enter &amp;c. For
whoſoeuer he be that dyeth ſeiſed within the yere &amp; the day after
ſuch claym, that ſhall not hurt him that made the claym, but that he may
enter though there wer many dyinges ſeiſed &amp; many diſcentes within
the yere &amp; the day &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if a man be diſſeyſed, and the
dyſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour dye ſeyſed within the yere and the day next after the
diſſeiſin done, wherby the tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes diſcende to his heyre, in thys
caſe the entre of the diſſeiſie is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away for the yere and the day
that ſhoulde helpe the diſſeiſie in ſuch caſe &amp;c. ſhall not
be taken from the tyme of the tytle of entre growen vnto hym, but onelye from
the tyme of the clayme by hym made in tyme aforeſayd. And for that cauſe it
ſhalbe good for ſuch a diſſeiſie for to make his claym &amp;c. in as
ſhort tyme as he may after the diſſeiſin &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if ſuch a diſſeiſour occupy the land by xl.
yeres without any claym made by the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſy &amp;c. &amp; the
diſſeiſy by little ſpace before the death of the diſſeiſour make
claim in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme aforeſayd, if ſo it fortune that within a yere and a day
after ſuch clayme the diſſeiſour dye ſeyſed &amp;c. the entre of
the diſſeiſie is congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for this it ſhalbe good for ſuch a
man that made no clayme that hath tytle to enter<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29073:93"/>&amp;c.
when he heareth that hys aduerſarye lyeth licke to make hys clayme.
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo as it is ſayd in the caſes put before where a
man hath tytle to entre becauſe of a diſſeiſin &amp;c. Theſame law is
where a manne hath ryght to enter becauſe of the tytle &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo in thys ſaid preſidentes may ye know my child
by .ii. thinges. One is where a man hath title to entre vpon a tenant in tayle,
if he make any ſuch clayme vnto the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp;c. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the ſtate of the

effect in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law as he wer vpon theſame tenementes, and had entred in
theſame tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as is aforeſayd. And then whan the tenant in tayle
immediatly after ſuch clayme continueth hys occupacion in the tenementes this
is a diſſeiſin made of theſame tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vnto him that made the
claym. Et ſic ꝑ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>¶The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thing is, that as oft as he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath right to

in queſtion yf ſuche releaſe bee good or not, &amp; ſome haue ſaid

after ſuche feoffemente by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offes to theyr feoffour to holde at theyr
wyl. &amp;c. and ſome haue ſayde the contrary and that for two cauſes.
One is that whan ſuch feoffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment is made vpon confidence to parfourme the
wil of the feoffour, that it ſhalbe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the law that the feoffor
by and by, ought to occupy the land, at the wil of hys feoffees, and ſo it is
ſuche maner of priuitie betwene them, as yf a manne make a feoffement to
another parſon and they incontinent vpon the feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wyll ſaye and
graunt that the feoffour ſhall occupye the lande at theyr wyll. &amp;c.
Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe they alledge that yf ſuche lande be woorth .xl.
<abbr>s.</abbr> by yere. &amp;c. Than ſuch a feoffour ſhalbe ſworne in
aſſyſes and in other inq<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtes in plees reals and alſo in plees
parſonels, of what great ſommes ſoeuer that the playntifs wyll declare.
&amp;c. And thys is by the common law of the land. Ergo thys is for a gret
cauſe, and the cauſe is that the law wyll that ſuche feoffours and their
heyres ought to occupy. &amp;c And to take therof the rent and all the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes and all maner of yſſues, and reuenues. &amp;c. As though the

ſayde that the releaſe made by ſuche<pb facs="tcp:29073:100"/>feoffes vppon
confidence to the feoffour, or to hys heyres et cetera. So occupying the lande.
&amp;c. ſhall bee good ynough &amp; cetera. And this is the better oppinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

the dyſſeaſour all the ryght that he hath. In thys caſe the
diſſeaſour hath hys ryght, ſo that wher his eſtate before was wrong,
now by the releaſe it is lawfull and ryght but note well that whan a manne is

releaſe vnto hym all the ryght that he hath in theſame tenem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes it nedeth

heires for wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys ryght was gone from him at one tyme by his releaſe
without any condicion. &amp;c. to hym that had fe ſymple it is gone for euer.
But where a man hath a reuercion, or a remaynder in fe ſymple at the tyme of
the releaſe made there yf he wyll releaſe to the tenaunt for terme of yeres
or for terme of lyfe, or to the tenaunt in the tayle, it behoueth to determyne

this ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is where one hath a rent charge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn land, and he
graunteth to the tenaunt of the land the rent charge and the cauſe is for
thys that it appeareth by the woordes of the graunt that the will of the donour
is that the tenant ſhall haue the rent &amp;c. in ſo much that he may haue
no rent out of hys own lande, for thys the dede ſhalbe vnderſtand and take
for the moſt aduauntage and auayle of the te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant that it may be, and that is
by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment. Alſo if I let land to a man for terme of yeres
&amp; after I confyrme hys eſtate without moe wordes put in the dede, he hath
no greater eſtate but for terme of yeres as he had before but if I releaſe
to hym my ryghte that I haue in the land without mo woordes put in the dede, he
hath eſtate of franke tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſo mayſt thou chyld vnderſtand gret
diuerſities betwene releſſees and confyrma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. And if I be within age
and let land to one for terme of .xx. yeres, and he graunteth the land for
terme of .x. yeres ſo that grant is but parcel of his terme. In this caſe
when I am of full age if I releaſe vnto the grauntee of my leſſee &amp;c.
Thys releaſe is voyde, for this that there is no priuitie betwene hym and me.
But if I confyrme hys eſtate then thys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmacion<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29073:112"/>is
good, but if my leſſee graunt all hys eſtate to another, then my
releaſe made to the grauntee is good and effectuall. Alſo if a man graunt a
rent charge out of hys land to another for terme of hys lyfe, and after I
con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyrme hys eſtate in the ſayd rent to haue, and to hold to hym in fee
tayle, or in fee ſymple, thys confyrmacion is voyd as to enlargeing of hys
eſtate for thys that he that confyrmed had no reuercion in the rent, but yf a
manne ſeyſed in fee of rent ſeruice or of rent charge, and he graunteth
the rent to another for term of lyfe and tenant attorneth, and after he
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmeth the eſtate of the grauntee in fee tayle or in fee ſimple, thys
confyrmacion is good as to enlarge his eſtate after the wordes of the dede of
confyrmacion, for thys that he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed the eſtate at the tyme of the
confirma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion hadde the reuercion of the rent &amp;c. but in thys caſe
aforeſayd, where a man graunteth a rent charge to another for terme of lyfe,
if he will that the grauntee ſhall haue eſtate in the tayle or in fee, hym
behoueth that the dede of the grauntee of the rent charge for tearme of lyfe,
be reſurrendred or councelled, and then to make a new dede of ſuche a rent

               <p>¶Alſo I haue hearde ſaye that in the time of kinge
Richarde the ſeconde there was a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the commen place dwellyng in
Kent, called Rikhyll, that had iſſue diuers ſonnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:29073:139"/>And hys entent was, that hys eldeſt ſonne
ſhoulde haue certayne landes to hym and the heyres of hys bodye begotten, and
for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faute of yſſue, the remayndre to hys ſeconde ſonne and ſo
foorth. And ſo the thyrde ſonne &amp; cetera. And becauſe that he woulde
that none of hys ſonnes ſhould alien or make war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rantie for to barre or to
hurte that other that ſhould be in the remayndre &amp;c. He cauſed to be
made an indenture to ſuche effect, that is to ſay that the landes and
tenementes were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to hys eldeſt ſonne vpon thys condicion, that yf the
eldeſt ſonne aliened in fee or in fee tayle &amp;c. or any of hys ſonnes
aliened &amp;c. that then theyr eſtate ſhould ceaſe and ſhoulde be
voyde, and that then the ſayd landes or tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes immediatly ſhould
remayne to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſonne and to the heyres of his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and
that vpon theſame condicion. S. that if the ſecond ſonne alien &amp;c.
that then his eſtate ſhould ceaſe, and that than theſame lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and
teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes ſhould remayn to the third ſonne, &amp; to the heyres of hys
body begotten &amp; ſo forth, the remaindre to other of his ſonnes and
liuere of ſeiſin was made according. But it ſemeth by reaſon that all
ſuch remayndres in the forme beforeſayde he voyde, and of no value, and
that for .iii. cauſes. One cauſe is becauſe that euery remaindre that
beginneth by a dede, it behoueth that the remayndre be in him to whom the
remayndre is tayled by force of theſame dede when the liuerey of ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29073:139"/>is made to hym that hath the franke tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſuch
remayndre was not at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſonne as the tyme of liuerey of ſeyſyn
in the caſe beforeſayd &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶The ſeconde cauſe is yf the fyrſt ſonne aliene the
tenementes in fee, then is the fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenement and the fee ſymple in the
alyenee and in none other, and if the donour had any reuercion by ſuche
alienacion, the reuercion is dyſcontinued, then though that by ſome
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it may be that ſuche remayndre ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne hys beyng and hys
growyng. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after ſuche alienacyon made to a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that hath
by theſame alienacion, franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenement and fee ſymple, and alſo yf ſuch
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayndre ſhould bee good, then myght he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon the alyenee where he
had no maner of ryght before the alienacyon, which ſhould be inconuenient.
The third cauſe is when the condicion is ſuch that if the eldeſt ſonne
ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en &amp;c. That hys eſtate ſhall ceaſe, or ſhall be voyde. &amp;c.
then after ſuche alienacion &amp;c. maye the donour entre by force of ſuche
condicion &amp;c. as it ſemeth, and ſo the donor or his heires in ſuch
caſe ought more ſoner to haue the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d then the ſecond ſonne that had
no ryght be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuche alienacion &amp;c. and ſo it ſemeth that ſuch
remayndres in the caſe before ſayde bee voyde.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo at the common lawe before the ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tute of
Gloceſtre yf tenaunt by the curteſye had aliened in fee with warranty
accordant,<pb facs="tcp:29073:140"/>after his deceaſe this was a barre to the heir
&amp;c. as it appeareth by the wordes of the ſame ſtatute. But it is
remedied by the ſame ſtatu. that the waranty of the tenaunt by the
curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſhal be no barre to the heire, except he haue inough by diſcent
by the tenaunt by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſye, for before the ſaide eſtatute that was a
collaterall warantye to the heyre, bicauſe he coulde not conuey anye title of
diſcent to the tenementes by the tenaunt by the curteſy, but onely by his
mother or other of his aunceſters &amp;c. and that is the cauſe why it was
collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall waranty. But if a manne enherite take a wife, whiche haue
iſſue a ſonne betwene them and the father dyeth, and the ſonne entreth
in the land, and endoweth his mother, &amp; after his mother alieneth that that
ſhe hath in her dower to an other in fee, with waranty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, and after
dyeth, and the warranty deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth to the ſonne, nowe the ſonne ſhall
be barred to demaunde the ſame Lande bycauſe of the ſaide warranty,
bicauſe that ſuch colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall warranty of tenaunt in dower is not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by any ſtatute. The ſame law is wher tenaunt for terme of life
maketh an alienaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with warranty. &amp;c. and dyeth, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
deſcendeth to him that had the reuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or the remaindre. &amp;c. they
ſhalbe barred by ſuche warranty. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo in the ſaide caſe if it ſo were that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
tenaunte in dower alyeneth. &amp;c. the heyre was within age, and alſo at
that time that the<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29073:140"/>warranty deſcendeth vpon him he was

notwithſtandynge the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty diſcended. &amp;c. bicauſe that no latches
ſhall be adiudged in the heyre within age, that he entred not vpon the
alience in the lyfe of the tenaunt in dower, but if the heyre was wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age
at the tyme of the alienacyon, and after he came to full age in the life of the
tenaunt in dower, and ſo beynge of full age he entred not in the life of
tenaunt in dower, and after the tenaunt in dower dyeth there paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the
heyre ſhalbe barred by ſuche warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bycauſe it ſhall be accompted
his folly that he beynge of full age, entred not in the life of tenaunt in
dower. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo it is ſpoken in the ende of the ſayde
eſtatute of Gloceſter that ſpeaketh of the alie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacion with warrantie
made by the tenaunte by the curteſy in ſuche forme.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo in the ſame maner the heyre of the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man after
the death of her father and mother ſhall not be barred of Accion if he
demaunde the heritage or the maryage of his mother by a writ of entre that his
father aliened in the tyme of his mother, wherof no fyne is leuyed in the
kynges courte. &amp;c. And ſo by force of the ſame ſtatute if the
huſbande of the wyfe alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the heritage or maryage of hys wife in fe with
warranty. &amp;c. by his dede in the country, this is clere lawe that this
warranty ſhal not barre the heire except he haue inough by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente
<pb facs="tcp:29073:141"/>&amp;c. But the doubt is if that the huſband alyen the heritage
of hys wyfe by fyne leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the kynges courte with warrantie et cetera, if
thys ſhall barre the heyre withoute any diſcent in value &amp;c. And as
ſo that I wil ſay here certayne reaſons that I haue heard ſay in this
matter I heard my maiſter ſyr Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Newton late chiefe iuſtice of the

that he haue nothyng by dyſcent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtatute ſayeth wherof no

warrantye by ſyne et cetera abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth yet a collaterall warrantie as it was at
the common lawe not remedied by the ſayde eſtatute becauſe that the
ſayd eſtatute excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the alienacions by fine with warrantie. And ſome
other haue ſayd and yet ſay the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye and thys is theyr proofe, that
as by the ſame Chapiter of the layde eſtatute it is ordeyned that the
warrantie of the tenaunt by the curteſye ſhall not barre the heyre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
he haue by ynough diſcente &amp;c. though that the tenaunt by the curteſye
leui a fyne of theſame landes with warrantie &amp; cetera, as ſtrongly as
he can, yet thys warranty ſhal not barre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heyre except he haue aſſetꝭ
or ynough by diſcent &amp;c. And I beleue that this is lawe and therfore they
ſay that it ſhould be inconue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nient to vnderſtand the ſtatute in ſuch
forme<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29073:141"/>that a manne that hath not but in the ryghte of his

right of his wyfe with warrantie &amp;c. ſhal barre the heyre of the ſayd
tenementes without diſcent of the fee ſimple &amp;c. where tenant by the
cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie can not dooe it. But they haue ſayde, that the ſtatute ſhalbe
vnderſtande after the fourme, that is to ſay where the ſtatute
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, wherof no fine is leuied in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges court this is to ſay
where no lawful fine is rightful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie leuied in theſame kynges court &amp;
that is wherof no fine of the huſband and his wyfe is leuied in the kinges
court, for at the time of the making of the ſayde ſtatute euery ſtate of
landes or tenementes that any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had that ſhoulde dyſcende to
hys heire was fee ſimple without condicion or vppon condicion in dede or in

the huſband and his wife, and that the huſband and the wyfe, and the heyres
of the huſbandes warrantie &amp;c. ſuch warrantie ſhuld barre the heyre
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶And ſo they ſay that this is the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of
the ſaid ſtatute, for if the hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the wyfe ſhall haue a writ of entree Sur cui in vita &amp; cetera,

then the heyre ſhoulde haue the writ of entre. &amp;c. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng the
fyne leuied by the huſbande and the wyfe bicauſe that the wordes of the
ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute before the exception of the fyne leuied. &amp;c. be generally.
&amp;c. that is to ſay, that the heir of the woman after the death of the
huſbande and the wife ſhall not be barred of accion if he demaunde the
heritage or the mariage of hys mother by a writ of entre that hys father
ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the time of his mother. And ſo it ſhold be in the caſe of the
ſtatute except ſuch words were, that is to ſaye, wherof no fyne is leuied
in the kynges courte. And ſo they ſaye that this to vnderſtand, wherof no
fine by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande and the wife is leuyed in the Kynges courte the whiche
is lawfully leuied in ſuche caſe. For if the iuſtices haue knowledge that
a man that hath nothynge but in the righte of his wyfe, wyll leuye a fyne in
his name onely they will not nor ought not to take ſuche fyne to be leuyed by
the huſbande onely wythout namynge the wyfe, therfore enquyre of thys
matter.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo it is to wytte that in ſuche woordes where the
heyre demaundeth the herytage or maryage of hys mother, this woorde is a
diſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unctyue, and is as muche to ſaye, if the heyre demaunde the heritage
of hys mother, that is to be vnderſtande the tenementes that hys mother had

taketh effect or cauſe of warrantyſe, than it ſhoulde be put in ſome
fynes leuyed in the kynges courte. And a man neuer ſawe that theſe woordes

               <p>¶Alſo if tenaunt in the tayle be ſeaſed of
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementes deuiſable by teſtamente after the cuſtome. &amp;c. And the
tenaunt in the tayle ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth the tenementes to hys brother in fee, and hath
iſſue &amp; dyeth, and after his brother deuideth by his teſtamente the

warrantyſe. &amp;c. And dyeth wythout iſſue, it ſemeth that thys
warrantye ſhall not barre the iſſue in the tayle if he wyll ſue hys
wryt of Formedon, bycauſe that his warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty diſcended not to the yſſue

<pb facs="tcp:29073:143"/>by force of theſame warrantie in hys lyfe. And thereof that he
coulde not warrant the land in hys lyfe, is in ſo much that the deuiſe
could not take anye execucion or effecte but after his deceaſe, and in ſo
muche that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in hys lyfe was not holde to warrante, ſuche
warrantiſe ne maye not diſcende from him to the yſſue in the tayle
&amp; cetera, for no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing maye dyſcende from the aunceſtre to his heire
but theſame that was in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtre. Alſo a warrantye maye not goe
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the nature of tenementes by cuſtome, but onelye after fourme of the
common lawe. For if tenant in tayle be ſeiſed in tenementes in borough
Engliſhe, where the cuſtome is that al tenementes of theſame borough
ought to dyſcende to the yongeſt ſonne, and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continueth the tayle
with warrantiſe &amp;c. and hath iſſue two ſonnes and dyeth ſeiſed
of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther landes and tenementes in the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe in Fee ſymple to the
value and more of the tenementes tayled and ſo forth, yet the yongeſt
ſonne ſhall haue a formedon of the te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nementes tayled, and ſhall not be
barred by the warrantiſe of his father though ynough to him diſcended in
fee ſimple fro theſame fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther after the cuſtome, for this that the
war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie diſcendeth vpon the elder brother that is in full life &amp;c. and
not vppon the younger ſonne. In theſame maner it is of collaterall
warrantiſe made of ſuche tenementes where the warrantiſe dyſcendeth to
the elder ſonne<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29073:143"/>&amp;c. this ſhal not barre the yonger
ſonne &amp;c. In theſame maner it is of teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in the ſhire of Kente,
whiche be called Gauelkinde, the whiche tenementes be departable among the
brethren &amp;c. after the cuſtome &amp; cetera, if anye ſuche warrantie be
made by their aunceſtres ſuche warrantyſe diſcendeth all onely to the
heyre that is heire by the common lawe, and not to all the heyres which are
heyres of ſuch tenementes after the cuſtome &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if a tenant in tayle haue iſſue two daughters
by diuers ventres, and dyeth, and the daughters entre and a ſtraunger
diſcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them of theſame tenementes, and one of the daughters
releſeth by her dede to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſour all her right and bindeth her

               <p>¶Alſo if tenant in the taile lette tenementes to another

for terme of life and dyeth, and the tenant in the tayle<pb facs="tcp:29073:144"/>hath
iſſue, and dyeth, now this iſſue is barred to aſke the tenements by
writ of formedone durynge the life of the tenaunte for terme of lyfe, bycauſe
of the collaterall deſcent vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iſſue in the tayle. But after the
deceaſe of the tenaunt for terme of lyfe, the iſſue ſhall haue a
formedon. &amp;c. And vpon this I haue hearde a reaſon that this caſe
ſhall proue by another caſe, that is to ſaye, if a man let hys lande to
another, to haue and to holde vnto hym, and to hys heyres for terme of anothers
lyfe, and the leſſour dyeth, leuynge hym to whoſe life. &amp;c And a
ſtraunger entreth in the lande that the heyre of the leſſee may put hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out, for this that in the caſe next afore ſayde, in ſo much that a man
may bynde hym and hys heyres to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the tenaunt for terme of lyfe, all
one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durynge the life of the tenaunte for terme of lyfe, and the warrantiſe
dyſcendeth to the heyre of him that made the warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
warrantyſe is no warrantyſe of inheritance but al onlye for terme of an
others life, by the ſame reaſon where tenementes be lette to a man to haue
and to holde to hym and to hys heyres for terme of anothers life, if the father
dye liuynge he to whoſe lyfe hys heyre ſhall haue the tenementes leuynge
hym to whoſe lyfe. &amp;c. For they haue ſayde that if a manne graunt an
annuity to an other to haue and to take to hym and to his heyres for terme of
an others life if the graunte dye. &amp;c. That after his heyre ſhall haue
the annuitie durynge the<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29073:144"/>lyfe of hym to whoſe lyfe.
&amp;c. Quere de iſta materia.</p>
               <p>¶But where ſuche leaſe or graunte is made to a man or
his heyres for terme of yeares, in this caſe the heyre of the leſſe, and
the graunt ſhall neuer haue after the death of the leſſee or the grauntee
that, that is ſo letten or graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for this that it is Chatell reall, and
all chatels reals by the common lawe ſhall come to the executors of the
graunte or of the leſſee and not to the heyre. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo in ſome caſes it may be that howbeit that a
collaterall warrantyſe be made in fee. &amp;c. yet ſuche warrantiſe maye
be defeated and anyented. As the tenaunt in the tayle diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the tayle
in fee, and the diſcontinue is diſſeyſed, and the brother of the tenant
in the tayle releaſeth by his dede to the diſſeyſoure all hys ryght.
&amp;c. with warrantyſe in fee, and dyeth without iſſue, and the tenaunte
in the tayle hathe iſſue, and dyeth, nowe the iſſue is barred of hys
accion by force of the collaterall warrantyſe deſcendynge vpon hym, but if
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thys the diſcontinue enter vpon the diſſey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſour, than maye the
heyres in the tayle haue hys accyon of formedon. &amp;c. for thys that the
warranty is anyentyd and defeated. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warrantiſe is made vnto a man
vpon any eſtate that then he had, if the eſtate be defeted the warranty is
defeted.</p>
               <p>¶In the ſame maner it is if the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuce make a

by a writ of formedon for this that, that warrantie collateral is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. And
ſo if any ſuch collateral warrantiſe be pleded againſt the iſſue in
the taile in his accion of formedon he may ſhew the mater as it is
aforeſayd, how the warrantie is defeted, and ſo he may wel mayntayn his
accion.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if tenant in the tayle make a feffeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his
vncle &amp; after his vncle maketh a feffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fee with warrantiſe
&amp;c. to another, &amp; after the feoffee of the vncle enfeffeth agayne the
vncle in fee. &amp; after the vncle enfeoffeth a ſtranger in fee without
warrantiſe, and dyeth without iſſue, and the tenant in the tayle will
brynge hys writte of formedone agaynſte the ſtraunger that was in the
feoffemente &amp; cete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, by the vncle, in this caſe the iſſue ſhall
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be barred by the warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie that was made by the vncle to the ſayd
firſt feoffee of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, for this that the ſayd warrantiſe was
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and anyented for thys that the vncle toke againe to him as great
eſtate of his ſaid firſt feoffe to whom the warrantie was made as
theſame feoffe hadde of him. And the cauſe why the warrantie is anyented,
in thys caſe<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29073:145"/>is this that is to ſaye, that if the
warrantiſe wer in his force, then the vncle ſhall warrant vnto hymſelfe
that may not be, but if the fef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee made eſtate to the vncle for terme of
life or in fee tayle, ſauing the reuercion vnto him et cetera. Or that he
make a gyft in the tayle to the vncle, or a leaſe for tearme of lyfe, the
remayndre ouer &amp; cetera. In this that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiſe is not all vtterlye

hadde, for after this that the vncle is deadde without iſſue, then he in

of his writ of formedon by the col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lateral warrantyſe in ſuch caſe,
&amp;c. But other wyſe it is, where the vncle hadde as greate eſtate in the
lande by the feoffe to whome the warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſe was made as he feoffee had of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if the vncle after ſuch feoffement made with
warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſe or a releaſe made by hym with warrantiſe be attaynt of felony
or outlawed of felony, ſuch collaterall warrantie ſhall not barre nor
grieue the iſſue in the tayle for this that by the attayndre of felonye the
blood is corrupt betwene them &amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo if tenant in the tayle be diſceiſed, &amp;
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maketh a releaſe to the diſſeiſour with war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rantiſe in fee and
after the tenant in the taile is attaynt, outlawed of felony and hath
yſſue, and dyeth, in thys caſe the yſſue in the tayle may enter vpon
the diſſeiſour.</p>
               <p>¶And the cauſe is for this that no thynge<pb facs="tcp:29073:146"/>maketh diſcontinuaunce in this caſe but the warrantie, and the
warrantie may not dyſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the iſſue in the tayle for thys that the
blood is corrupt betwene hym that made the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie, and the iſſue in the
tayle. For the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiſe alway abydeth at the common lawe, &amp; the common
lawe is ſuch that whan a man is outlawed or attaynt of felony, which outlary
is an attayndre in the law that the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene hym and his ſonne and all
other which ſhould be ſayd hys heyres is corrupte, ſo that nothyng by
diſcent may diſcende to any that may be hys heyre by the common lawe. And
the wyfe of ſuch a man that is ſo attaynt ſhal neuer be endowed in the
tenementes of her huſband ſo attaynt.</p>
               <p>¶And the cauſe is becauſe men ſhould more eſchew to
dooe felony &amp;c. But the iſſue in the tayle, as to the tenementes tayled
is not in ſuche caſe barred becauſe he is inheryted by force of the
ſtatute and not by the courſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common lawe. And therfore ſuch
attayndre of hys father or of hys aunceſtre in the tayle &amp;c. ſhall not
putte hym out of his ryghte, that he ſhould haue by force of the tayle
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶Alſo yf tenaunt in the tayle enfeoffeth hys vncle which
enfeoffeth another with war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranty &amp;c. if after the feoffe by hys dede

there, wherby a man may defete warranties.</p>
               <p>¶And it is to wyt that in theſame maner as collaterall
warrantye may bee defeted by matter in dede or in lawe, in the ſame maner may
